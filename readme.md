# Whim Application Rules

This parses the community-driven [application rules](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi-application-specific-configuration) for [Komorebi](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi), and generates corresponding rules for [Whim](https://github.com/dalyIsaac/Whim).

Note that the source repository is currently unlicensed, but Komorebi itself is under the MIT license. TODO: figure out how to correctly attribute to these sources.
